Go const converts a go string into a file which can be consumed by another
language.

The input is any go file, of a specified type, and the output is a file in
another language. For the moment we are targetting typescript for my own projects.

Each type should output a file in the specified target directory;

This takes inspiration from golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer

```go
type eventType string

const (
	// User has been added to the system
	USER_INVITED eventType = "user_invited"
	// New task has been created on a project
	TASK_CREATED eventType = "task_created"
	// Update to an existing task
	TASK_UPDATED eventType = "task_updated"
	// New file has been uploaded to the system
	FILE_UPLOADED eventType = "file_uploaded"
)
```

```typescript
// Code generated by goconst, do not edit
export type eventType =
	// User has been added to the system
	USER_INVITED |
	// New task has been created on a project
	TASK_CREATED |
    ...

export const eventTypes = [
	USER_INVITED,
	TASK_CREATED,
    ...
];
```


OR an alternative way to write it might be

```typescript
const eventTypes = [
	// User has been added to the system
	USER_INVITED,
	// New task has been created on a project
	TASK_CREATED,
] as const;

type EventType = typeof eventTypes[number]
```
